# Dummy-Spotify-UI
Dummy Spotify UI created using Html,Css,Js.


I created a dummy Spotify page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to recreate the main page of Spotify, showcasing my skills in front-end web development.

The page is structured using HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript. I hope you like it!

Here is a more detailed explanation of the project:

HTML: I used HTML to create the different sections of the page, such as the header, main content, and footer. I also used HTML to define the structure of the page, such as the order of the elements and the relationships between them.
CSS: I used CSS to style the different elements of the page, such as the fonts, colors, and layouts. I also used CSS to add animations and other effects to the page.
JavaScript: I used JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic features.
